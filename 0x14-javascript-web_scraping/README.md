## JSON
JSON, meaning JavaScript Object Notation is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.

* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use request and fetch API
